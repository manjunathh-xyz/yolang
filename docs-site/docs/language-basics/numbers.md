# Numbers

Numbers in Kexra represent numeric values, supporting basic arithmetic operations.

## Why this exists

Numbers enable mathematical computations and quantitative data handling in programs.

## How it works

Numbers are floating-point values. All numeric literals are treated as numbers.

## Examples

```kx
set x = 42
set y = 3.14
say x + y  # 45.14
```

## Common mistakes

- Assuming integer division (all division is floating-point)
- Not handling floating-point precision issues
