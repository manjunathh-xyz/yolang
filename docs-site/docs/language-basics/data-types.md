# Data Types

Kexra supports several built-in data types for different kinds of values.

## Why this exists

Different data types allow programs to represent various kinds of information appropriately.

## How it works

Each value has a type: number, string, boolean, null, array, object.

## Examples

```kx
set num = 42        # number
set str = "hello"   # string
set bool = true     # boolean
set nil = null      # null
set arr = [1, 2]    # array
set obj = {a: 1}    # object
```

## Common mistakes

- Mixing incompatible types in operations
- Not checking types before operations
