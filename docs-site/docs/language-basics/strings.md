# Strings

Strings in Kexra represent sequences of characters, enclosed in double quotes.

## Why this exists

Strings enable text processing and user interface elements in programs.

## How it works

Strings are immutable sequences of characters. Use double quotes for literals.

## Examples

```kx
set name = "Kexra"
say "Hello, " + name  # Concatenation
```

## Common mistakes

- Using single quotes (only double quotes supported)
- Forgetting to escape special characters
