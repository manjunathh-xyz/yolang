# Common Mistakes

Avoid these frequent pitfalls when starting with Kexra to ensure smooth learning and development.

## Why this exists

Beginners often encounter similar issues due to differences from other languages or misunderstandings of Kexra's design.

## How it works

This page lists common errors with explanations and solutions, helping users recognize and fix problems quickly.

## Examples

- **Case sensitivity**: `Say` vs `say` - Kexra is case-sensitive
- **Statement separation**: Use newlines, not semicolons
- **Variable initialization**: `set x = 5` not `set x`

## Common mistakes

- Using semicolons instead of newlines
- Forgetting quotes around strings
- Confusing `set` and `const`
- Expecting dynamic typing to work like other languages
