# Hello World

The traditional first program in any language, demonstrating basic output in Kexra.

## Why this exists

"Hello World" serves as the simplest introduction to a language's syntax and execution.

## How it works

The `say` statement outputs its argument to the console, followed by a newline.

## Examples

```kx
say "Hello, World!"
```

Output:

```
Hello, World!
```

## Common mistakes

- Forgetting quotes around the string
- Using `print` instead of `say`
