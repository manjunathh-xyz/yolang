# First Program

Your first Kexra program demonstrates basic output and arithmetic, introducing core concepts like statements and expressions.

## Why this exists

A first program provides immediate feedback and builds confidence in using the language, showing how to write and execute code.

## How it works

Programs are text files with `.kx` extension containing statements. The `say` statement outputs values, and expressions combine values with operators.

## Examples

```kx
# First program: hello.kx
say "Hello, Kexra!"

# With arithmetic
say 2 + 3
say "The answer is " + (10 * 2)
```

## Common mistakes

- Forgetting the `.kx` extension
- Using invalid syntax (e.g., missing quotes for strings)
- Not saving the file before running
