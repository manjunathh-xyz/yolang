# Language Philosophy

Kexra follows principles of simplicity, determinism, and learnability, prioritizing code clarity and predictable execution over performance or advanced features.

## Why this exists

The philosophy guides all design decisions in Kexra, ensuring the language remains focused on its goals of education and experimentation.

## How it works

- **Simplicity**: Minimal syntax and concepts
- **Determinism**: Same input always produces same output
- **Learnability**: Concepts build progressively
- **Clarity**: Code should be self-explanatory

## Examples

```kx
# Clear, readable code
set name = "Kexra"
say "Hello, " + name
```

## Common mistakes

- Adding unnecessary complexity
- Sacrificing clarity for brevity
