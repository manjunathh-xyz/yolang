# Basic Syntax

Kexra's syntax is designed for readability: statements separated by newlines, keywords in lowercase, and minimal punctuation.

## Why this exists

Understanding basic syntax rules prevents syntax errors and enables writing correct programs from the start.

## How it works

Programs consist of statements ending with newlines. Keywords are reserved words, identifiers start with letters.

## Examples

```kx
# Comment
say "Hello"  # Statement
set x = 42   # Another statement
```

## Common mistakes

- Using semicolons
- Starting identifiers with numbers
- Misspelling keywords
