# Code Style

Coding standards and conventions for Kexra development.

## Why this exists

Consistent code style improves readability and maintainability.

## How it works

Use automated tools for formatting and linting, follow established patterns.

## Examples

- camelCase for variables/functions
- PascalCase for classes/interfaces
- UPPER_CASE for constants
- TypeScript with strict settings

## Common mistakes

- Manual formatting instead of using tools
- Inconsistent naming conventions
- Not running linting before commits
