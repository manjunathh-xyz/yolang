# Why Kexra Exists

Kexra was created to fill the gap between simple scripting and complex programming languages, providing an accessible entry point for beginners while remaining useful for small projects.

## Why this exists

Programming languages often fall into two categories: too simple for real tasks or too complex for learning. Kexra bridges this gap by offering a language that's easy to learn but capable of handling practical scripting needs.

## How it works

Kexra's design focuses on minimalism and clarity. It includes just enough features to be useful without overwhelming newcomers, built on a deterministic runtime that ensures predictable behavior.

## Examples

Kexra can be used for:

- Automating simple tasks
- Prototyping ideas
- Learning programming concepts
- Small utility scripts

## Common mistakes

- Expecting Kexra to handle large-scale applications (it's designed for small scripts)
- Assuming it has all features of mature languages
