# Case Sensitivity

Kexra is case-sensitive, meaning `say` and `Say` are different identifiers.

## Why this exists

Case sensitivity allows more expressive naming while requiring careful attention to capitalization.

## How it works

Keywords and identifiers distinguish between uppercase and lowercase letters.

## Examples

```kx
say "hello"  # Works
Say "hello"  # Error: undefined
```

## Common mistakes

- Capitalizing keywords
- Inconsistent variable naming
