# What is Kexra

Kexra is a small, expressive scripting language designed for learning, experimentation, and rapid prototyping. It combines the simplicity of scripting languages with the reliability of statically-typed systems.

## Why this exists

Kexra was created to provide a gentle introduction to programming concepts without the complexity of larger languages. It serves as both an educational tool and a practical scripting language for small projects.

## How it works

Kexra programs are interpreted and executed in a deterministic, single-threaded environment. The language focuses on clarity and predictability, making it ideal for learning programming fundamentals.

## Examples

```kx
# Simple greeting
say "Hello, Kexra!"

# Basic arithmetic
say 2 + 3  # Outputs: 5
```

## Common mistakes

- Forgetting that Kexra is case-sensitive
- Not understanding that all statements must end with a newline
