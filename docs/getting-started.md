# Getting Started

This guide will walk you through writing and running your first Kexra program.

## Hello World

Create a new file called `hello.kx` with this content:

```kx
say "Hello, World!"
```

## Running Your Program

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
kex run hello.kx
```

You should see:

```
🚀 Kexra v0.4.2
Running: hello.kx
──────────────────────────
Hello, World!
```

## Understanding the Code

- `say` is a built-in command that outputs text
- Strings are enclosed in double quotes
- Each statement ends with a newline

## Next Steps

Now that you can run programs, learn about [installation](installation.md) or explore [language basics](language-basics.md).
