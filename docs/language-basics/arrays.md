# Arrays

Arrays in Kexra store ordered collections of values.

## Why this exists

Arrays enable grouping related data and performing operations on collections.

## How it works

Arrays are created with `[]` syntax. Elements are accessed by index starting from 0.

## Examples

```kx
set numbers = [1, 2, 3]
say numbers[0]  # 1
```

## Common mistakes

- Accessing out-of-bounds indices
- Confusing arrays with objects
