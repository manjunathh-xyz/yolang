# Comments

Comments in Kexra provide explanatory text ignored by the interpreter.

## Why this exists

Comments document code for human readers, improving maintainability.

## How it works

Single-line comments start with `#`. Everything after `#` on a line is ignored.

## Examples

```kx
# This is a comment
say "Hello"  # Inline comment
```

## Common mistakes

- Using multi-line comments (not supported)
- Forgetting `#` for comments
