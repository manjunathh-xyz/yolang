# Execution Lifecycle

How Kexra programs are parsed, compiled, and executed.

## Why this exists

Understanding execution helps developers write efficient, correct code.

## How it works

Programs go through lexing, parsing, and interpretation phases in sequence.

## Examples

1. Source code → Tokens (lexing)
2. Tokens → AST (parsing)
3. AST → Execution (interpretation)

## Common mistakes

- Assuming compilation happens
- Not understanding interpretation overhead
