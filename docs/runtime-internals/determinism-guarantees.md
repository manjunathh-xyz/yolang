# Determinism Guarantees

Kexra's commitment to predictable, reproducible execution.

## Why this exists

Determinism ensures programs behave consistently across runs and environments.

## How it works

Single-threaded execution and absence of timing-dependent operations guarantee deterministic behavior.

## Examples

- No race conditions
- Consistent execution order
- Reproducible results

## Common mistakes

- Assuming non-deterministic behavior
- Depending on external timing
- Using async features incorrectly
